# QMC-tutorial
This repository provides the supporting material of the paper **A brief introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo method and the fixed-node approximation** by Alfonso Annarelli, Dario Alf√® and Andrea Zen [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 241501 (2024), https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0232424].

Each folder name refers to a specific Section within the main text. All `.c` codes for the DMC simulation share the same fundamental structure, with minimal variations related to the specific toy model (e.g. the node-crossing check for the two-fermion system). They can be easily modified to explore any kind of one-dimensional or three-dimensional radial potential.

The notebooks `.ipynb` can be used to generate the figures in the paper.
The `info.txt` files specify the simulation parameters for each set of data.
