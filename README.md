# QMC-tutorial
This repository provides the supporting material of the paper **A brief introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo method and the fixed-node approximation** by Alfonso Annarelli, Dario Alf√® and Andrea Zen.

Each folder name refers to a specific Section within the main text. All _C_ codes for the DMC simulation share the same fundamental structure, with minimal modifications related to each specific toy model (e.g. the fixed node approximation for the two-fermion system). They can be easily modified to explore any type of one-dimensional or three-dimensional radial potential.

The data for plotting all of the graphs in the main text and supplemental material can be found in the folder `Data`. The notebook analyse.ipynb can be explored interactively with Colab. The figures generated by analyse.ipynb are stored in the Figures folder.
